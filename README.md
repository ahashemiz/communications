## Getting Started

In this linear regression notebook, we use several python packages. Here is how you can install them from the command-line:

`pip install pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels`

## Description

This jupyter notebook contains a simple example of how to perform and analyze the results from a simple linear regression model using the statsmodel python package.
The dataset is the WHO Life Expectancy Dataset, which can be found on Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who?select=Life+Expectancy+Data.csv">WHO Life Expectancy Dataset</a>

We regress a country's average life expectancy on its citizens' average number of years spent in school. Surprisingly, we found a high level of correlation
between these two variables in this dataset. 

This notebook also includes analysis of the assumptions of the linear model as well as to what degree the data 
follows these assumptions.

## About This Guide

This guide is one of the deliverables of a group project for Communications for Analytics class (MSDS 610). MSDS 610 is a core class in the Master of Science in Data Science program at the University of San Francisco.

The goal of this guide is to provide a concise and “hands-on” introduction to linear regression, with an emphasis on simple linear regression (SLR). This is to keep things as simple as possible whilst still conveying the essence of linear regression. 

This guide is meant to be accessible to those with just enough (bittersweet) memories of introductory probability, statistics, linear algebra, and Python programming. To this end, we have structured the guide as follows: 

(1) SLR in a Nutshell — “No-frills” overview of the essentials and motivation for SLR.

(2) SLR in Practice — End-to-end tutorial on implementing SLR in Python.
