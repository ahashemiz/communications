## Getting Started

In this linear regression notebook, we use several python packages. Here is how you can install them from the command-line:

`pip install pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels`

## Description

This jupyter notebook contains a simple example of how to perform and analyze the results from a simple linear regression model using the statsmodel python package.
The dataset is the WHO Life Expectancy Dataset, which can be found on Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who?select=Life+Expectancy+Data.csv">WHO Life Expectancy Dataset</a>

We regress a country's average life expectancy on its citizens' average number of years spent in school. Surprisingly, we found a high level of correlation
between these two variables in this dataset. 

This notebook also includes analysis of the assumptions of the linear model as well as to what degree the data 
follows these assumptions.
