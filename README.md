## Getting Started

In this linear regression notebook, we use several python packages. Here is how you can install them from the command-line:

`pip install pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, statsmodels`

## Description

This jupyter notebook contains a simple example of how to perform and analyze the results from a simple linear regression model using the statsmodel python package.
The dataset is the WHO Life Expectancy Dataset, which can be found on Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who?select=Life+Expectancy+Data.csv">WHO Life Expectancy Dataset</a>
